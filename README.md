## We have moved! üè° üöö üè° 

As of June 2020, our new home is https://github.com/golang/vscode-go.

As this extension that adds rich language support for the [Go language](https://golang.org/) to VS Code
has grown in features and popularity, it has required more maintenance and support.
Since the introduction of Go modules, we have been collaborating with the Go team, particularly on support
for `gopls`, the [Go language server](https://golang.org/s/gopls/README.md). More exciting work is on the horizon with the
[debug adapter service](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/service/dap) in delve which will help
improve the debugging experience.

Moving to the [golang GitHub organization](https://github.com/golang) brings us closer to the home of other tools
and libraries that the Go extension depends on. We hope this will help keep the extension tightly coupled with the Go 
language and encourage more Gophers to get involved.
