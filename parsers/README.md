`tree-sitter-go.wasm` is an incremental parser for Go using the [Tree Sitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) framework. It's generated by `npm run-script gen-parser`. 

It's more convenient to check the .wasm file into source than to run `gen-parser` as part of the build, because `gen-parser` requires a C++ toolchain on the host. If you want to regenerate `tree-sitter-go.wasm`, I recommend using an Ubuntu linux host.
